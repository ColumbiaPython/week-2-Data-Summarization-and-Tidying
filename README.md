# Introduction to Statistics Analysis: Pair T-test, Chi Square Test, Lineaer Regression
The main goal of this lecture:

## Part one: class organization
1. introduce new students in the class (name, program, goal for data analytics)

## Part two: programming

for all students

1. Pair T-test: 
a. example question, concepts, data analysis

2. Chi Square Test: 
a. example question, concepts, data analysis

3. Lineaer Regression: 
a. example question, concepts, data analysis
b. what if we double the sample data, how would the linear regression result change?
c. what if we replace the missing data with average, how would the linear regression result change?

for the new students only (a makeup 30min section after class)
1. terminal operation: call jupyter notebook, learn about 'pip install XXXXX'
2. notebook from week1: intro to Pandas, load dataset into jupyter notebook, data exploration analysis, data cleaning
3. notebook from week1: learn about data structure (Lecture_One_Data_Structure.ipynb)

## Part three: project management
1. make sure all students are the members of ColumbiaPython organization in Github
2. every student create individual project in ColumbiaPython (nameing: Project_lastname)
3. start writing proposal in github as a readme file
4. upload new files into github (reference papers, data & codes)
